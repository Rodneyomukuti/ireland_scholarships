A review on the ireland scholarshps posted

I have gone through the scholarships via the link you shared, and I came up with the following:

## Schools
Of the schools listed on [this website](https://eurireland.ie/assets/uploads/2021/11/GOI-IES-Call-2022.pdf), three are recognized to offer an M.sc in Molecular biology. That is:
- Trinity College Dublin
- University College Dublin
- University College Cork

Trinity college Dublin offers a post graduate diploma and an M.sc in [Molecular medicine](https://www.tcd.ie/courses/search/?keywords=molecular%20biology&type=postgraduate), University College Dublin has an M.sc in [Biotechnology](https://www.ucd.ie/sbbs/study/taughtgraduateprogrammes/), and University College Cork has [Molecular cell Biology with Bioinnovation](https://www.ucc.ie/en/ckr44/). I therefore dug deeper into molecular cell biology with bioinnovation.

Molecular Cell Biology with Bioinnovation is a 1-year course within which the course work and dissertation are completed. They have provided a [course outline](https://www.ucc.ie/en/ckr44/) and some [requirements](https://www.ucc.ie/en/ckr44/). 

My main goal is to apply molecular biology and bioinformatics in conservation, as I am trying to show [here](https://github.com/Rodneyomukuti/ICIPE_Bioinformatics-Internship). Therefore, I am wondering if this course will be broad and deep enough for my career. Kindly advice

# Advice:
I do think the course as outlines is a little shallow for what you want to achieve. However, it is equally lucrative and the internship you are now undertaking might make up for any inadequacies the program may have. If it has a project component (often these 1-yr masters have a 3 months mini-project component), you could make your project be about bioinformatics. I like that it is short (1 yr) which gives you a qualification to first get into a PhD where now you can focus on Bioinformatics. I'd say just apply regardless...

# Motivation and readiness to join UCC

I am writing to express my interest in the masters program in Molecular Cell Biology and Bio innovation at the University College Cork. I completed my undergraduate degree in Biology (Zoology) and I am awaiting graduation which is scheduled for April 2022. My undergraduate program is a field with a wide array of bioscience research opportunities. However, such opportunities are less exploited especially in Kenya and other African countries because of lack of resources and infrastructure. If not acted upon, this tradition might last years before we realize the importance of investing in such programs. 

My undergraduate program is designed in such a way that it offers an in-depth understanding of various aspects across different disciplines. This includes biology, chemistry and mathematics. My interest in research developed during my junior years in campus, whereby I was curious in understanding the different aspects that we encounter is our daily lives. There are many challenges that face Africa and the world at large which include climate change, food insecurity, poverty, diseases, just to mention a few. To address this, Kenya and other African countries need a well-designed platform which encompasses education and research. 

My hard work and determination made me realize my interest in molecular biology and genetics – a field with limitless potentials. I decided to seek opportunities that could help build my proficiency in genomics. This made my genetics lecturer and researcher Dr. Sammy Wambua allow me to work with him in his projects, as he coached me on many different aspects. Some of the projects that I volunteered in include: The sea turtle immunogenetics study which aims at establishing the genetic drivers of fibropapillomatosis in green sea turtles, and the Billfish – WIO project. This aims at understanding the genetic structure of billfish and evaluate the population stock structure of the different billfish species and their zonation within the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) region. Furthermore, I undertook a three – month internship at Local Ocean Conservation (LOC) which is an NGO that works to protect the marine ecosystem while conserving turtles as their flagship species. 

Through the internship at LOC, I noticed a gap between conservation biology and genetics, that has not been addressed adequately. Here, conservation is done based on what is seen and thought, leaving out the fact that what is seen is a dictate of genetic organization or composition of a particular organism. There is a pressing need to understand organisms at the molecular level, which will inform on species delimitations, vulnerability, adaptability, and connectivity helping to strategically make conservation decisions. I also hypothesized that genome scale data will improve the capacity of resource managers to protect endangered, threatened or vulnerable species. This made me realize the need to have knowledge and skills in bioinformatics, and as a result, I am currently on a four – month bioinformatics internship and incubation program at the International Center of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) in Nairobi. 

Having been guided by the factors above, I decided to develop a career in molecular biology. This is greatly persuaded by the application of cell biology in forensic DNA analysis to curb poaching, conserving ecosystems and protecting endangered species. I strongly believe that this program will equip me with the necessary skills for my career and help me build my innovative skills as far as science is concerned. I will also have the opportunity to interact with people from different spheres of life and social backgrounds, receive mentorship, interact with senior scientists who are potentially future collaborators, and help in building my profile increasing chances for future training in the same or a related field. 

While I am mainly driven by this training and research, I look forward to gaining experience and learning public speaking skills, and presentation skills.
