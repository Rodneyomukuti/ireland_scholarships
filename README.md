A review on the ireland scholarshps posted

I have gone through the scholarships via the link you shared, and I came up with the following:

## Schools
Of the schools listed on [this website](https://eurireland.ie/assets/uploads/2021/11/GOI-IES-Call-2022.pdf), three are recognized to offer an M.sc in Molecular biology. That is:
- Trinity College Dublin
- University College Dublin
- University College Cork

Trinity college Dublin offers a post graduate diploma and an M.sc in [Molecular medicine](https://www.tcd.ie/courses/search/?keywords=molecular%20biology&type=postgraduate), University College Dublin has an M.sc in [Biotechnology](https://www.ucd.ie/sbbs/study/taughtgraduateprogrammes/), and University College Cork has [Molecular cell Biology with Bioinnovation](https://www.ucc.ie/en/ckr44/). I therefore dug deeper into molecular cell biology with bioinnovation.

Molecular Cell Biology with Bioinnovation is a 1-year course within which the course work and dissertation are completed. They have provided a [course outline](https://www.ucc.ie/en/ckr44/) and some [requirements](https://www.ucc.ie/en/ckr44/). 

My main goal is to apply molecular biology and bioinformatics in conservation, as I am trying to show [here](https://github.com/Rodneyomukuti/ICIPE_Bioinformatics-Internship). Therefore, I am wondering if this course will be broad and deep enough for my career. Kindly advice

# Advice:
I do think the course as outlines is a little shallow for what you want to achieve. However, it is equally lucrative and the internship you are now undertaking might make up for any inadequacies the program may have. If it has a project component (often these 1-yr masters have a 3 months mini-project component), you could make your project be about bioinformatics. I like that it is short (1 yr) which gives you a qualification to first get into a PhD where now you can focus on Bioinformatics. I'd say just apply regardless...
